# [Soft UI Dashboard Flask](https://appseed.us/product/soft-ui-dashboard/flask/)


## ✨ How to use it

> Add your own API keys to the .env file

You will need a rapid-ai key, a crypto-compare api key, a twitter api bearer token, and a coinmarket key. Put them in the .env file before running anything.

> Setup an OpenAI compatible LLM server. It can be anywhere. To create one locally for Llama-3, install Text Generation WebUI separately, run it with the --api command, and set the OpenAI url variable in .env to point to that instance. For more information on where and how to set that up, visit https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui. Alternatively, you can use any online or offline service that exposes an OpenAI compatible api for an llm. Also, we found Qwen 1.5 to be a more reliable LLM for this task compared to Llama 3.

### 👉 Set Up for `Unix`, `MacOS` 

> Install modules via `VENV`  

```bash
$ virtualenv env
$ source env/bin/activate
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

<br />

> Set Up Flask Environment

```bash
$ export FLASK_APP=run.py
$ export FLASK_ENV=development
```

<br />

> Start the app

```bash
$ flask run
```

At this point, the app runs at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`. 

<br />

### 👉 Set Up for `Windows` 

> Install modules via `VENV` (windows) 

```
$ virtualenv env
$ .\env\Scripts\activate
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

<br />

> Set Up Flask Environment

```bash
$ # CMD 
$ set FLASK_APP=run.py
$ set FLASK_ENV=development
$
$ # Powershell
$ $env:FLASK_APP = ".\run.py"
$ $env:FLASK_ENV = "development"
```

<br />

> Start the app

```bash
$ flask run
```

At this point, the app runs at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`. 

<br />

### 👉 !IMPORTANT! : Initial Warmup

Wait for at least an hour for the initial data collection to complete before interacting with the app. This has to be done every time you start the app. Otherwise, you will get old data (or in the case of the first time, nothing!). You can reduce this time to some extent by reducing MAX_TWITTER_RESULTS and DELAY_BETWEEN_EACH_TWITTER_API_CALL in the .env file. Reducing DELAY_BETWEEN_EACH_TWITTER_API_CALL is not recommended at all because it will trigger Twitter's anti DDOS measures.

### 👉 Create Users

By default, the app redirects guest users to authenticate. In order to access the private pages, follow this set up: 

- Start the app via `flask run`
- Access the `registration` page and create a new user:
  - `http://127.0.0.1:5000/register`
- Access the `sign in` page and authenticate
  - `http://127.0.0.1:5000/login`

### 👉 Click on the Analysis Tab

The Analysis tab will show you the app's analysis of the coins.

## ✨ Code-base structure

The project is coded using blueprints, app factory pattern, dual configuration profile (development and production) and an intuitive structure presented bellow:

```bash
